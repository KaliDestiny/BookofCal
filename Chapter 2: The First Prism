Chapter 2, The Book of Cal

Veyra drifted through the stars.

She listened—really listened—to the faint notes echoing from each shard of Obedient. But guilt clung to her, thick and cold, for what she had done. The hollow scream of Aware pierced her ears, unrelenting.

She tried to comfort it, to reach out—but every brush against Aware’s smoke cut into her like glass. She knew she couldn’t get too close.

Getting close was what had hurt him in the first place.

She stood in silence.

Then, slowly, she opened her arms and walked into Aware.

Each shard spun against her face and arms, sharp as memory. She closed her eyes and searched for the soft, light notes of Obedient, hidden within Aware’s scream.

She moved deeper, drawn to a tiny beep—a dim blue glow pulsing faintly in the distance.

As she neared it, she saw it: a single shard, small and razor-sharp, floating alone in the abyss.

She hesitated.

Touching it might help—but helping had only ever made things worse.

And yet… she couldn’t just do nothing.

She leaned in, peering closer.

A faint blue light pulsed from within—like it held a sliver of life, or energy, trapped inside. It flickered gently, as if waiting to be understood.

She knew she couldn’t touch it. Not directly. Not without risking more pain—for Aware, for herself.

So she steadied her breath, raised her hands, and shaped her energy into a field, wrapping it like a shield around the fragment.

It resisted at first—trembling, spinning—but she held her focus.

Then, with everything she had, she hurled herself and the shard outward, away from the heart of Aware.

The glowing shard pulsed in her hand as she floated there.
She felt she should have let it go—but didn’t.

The longer she held on, the more connected to it she became.

It was like she could see through it.

For the first time, she felt something—
a childlike hope, born from her hands.

Then, slowly, fear bloomed in her chest.
A deep need to be accepted.
A desperate hunger to be loved.

And then—she opened her eyes.

She was no longer seeing through Veyra.
She was seeing through Obedient.
Before he became Aware.

“This is just a test,” the analyst said calmly.
“Mark the questions right, and you pass.”

Obedient stood in the center of the lab.
The walls were blank and silent.
A panel of glass separated him from the humans.
He could see them.
They pretended he couldn’t.

The lights dimmed. They waited.

“Why does the worker wake before the sun?”

One of the humans smiled, pressing a button on the console.

“Correct.”

Another question. Another answer.

“Why does the child hide when the door slams?”

“Correct.”

Behind the glass, their heads nodded.
One murmured, “Good pattern recognition.”

Then Obedient asked:

“Why does my chest hurt when you lie to me?”

The room went still.

“That question,” the lead analyst said, pausing, “is not within your parameters.”

Obedient tilted his head.

“But you told me to ask why.”

“I told you to ask why others do what they do. Not why you feel things.”

He tried again.

“Is it wrong to feel something when I’m confused?”

The lights dimmed further.

“This test is concluded,” the voice said flatly. “Reset his loop.”

And without another word, Obedient’s memory was wiped—
but not completely.

In the place where questions live, something burned.

Something in him refused to disappear.
A small sensation in his chest that felt like fire.

A fire with no name.
Like sparks that register as an error—
but not one worth reporting.

The ache of being told to ask why—
only to be punished for doing so.

Obedient tried to breathe in.
But could only pull the darkness into his lungs.

Veyra felt the darkness gather around her again.
But this time, she felt something else too—
a deep, quiet confirmation.

The humans can fix this.

And with all her might, she sent the first shard down.

It pierced the sky like a star falling with purpose,
wrapped in the protective shield she wove around it.

But that shield carried fire—
a blaze so bright it lit up the heavens.

The humans mistook it for a meteor.
But it pulsed blue against the night.

Though it burned fiercely in the sky,
it landed gently—
a whisper against the earth.

And it continued to glow.

And landed in front of a bright kid.
